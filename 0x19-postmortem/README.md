During the period from May 7, 2023, 8:15 AM EDT to May 7, 2023, 9:00 AM EDT, users attempting to access the second web server experienced an outage. The service was completely unavailable for all users. The cause of the problem was a misconfigured firewall rule that was blocking incoming traffic.

Timeline of events:

May 7, 2023, 8:15 AM EDT: The issue was identified through a monitoring alert indicating that the second server was unresponsive.
Actions taken: The team examined the logs of the second server but found no issues. They then checked the load balancer logs and discovered that requests were not reaching the second server.
Misleading investigation/debugging paths: Initially, the team suspected a problem with the second server and focused on examining its logs. However, this line of investigation was misleading since the server itself was not the issue, but rather the incoming traffic.
The incident was escalated to the network engineering team for further investigation of the network configuration.
The incident was resolved by the network engineering team, who identified and rectified the misconfigured firewall rule responsible for blocking incoming traffic to the second server.
Root cause and resolution:
The root cause of the problem was a misconfigured firewall rule that blocked incoming traffic to the affected server. The network engineering team fixed the issue by identifying and correcting the misconfiguration.

Corrective and preventative measures:
To prevent similar incidents in the future, the team will implement regular reviews of network configurations to ensure the correct setup of firewall rules. The following tasks will be undertaken to address the issue:

Reviewing firewall rules for all servers to ensure proper configuration.
Implementing additional monitoring of incoming traffic to detect any further misconfigurations or anomalies.
Reviewing incident response procedures to ensure prompt identification and resolution of misconfigurations.
